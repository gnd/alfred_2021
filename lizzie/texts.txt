> If I had a horse it would

< Be something in me I would know. If I had a horse it would Let me know 
what it knows. If I had a horse it would Show me how to be strong. If I 
had a horse it would Be there when I was wrong. If I had a horse it would 
Never tell me to go home. If I had a horse it would Stay there when I was 
sad. If I had a horse it would Be there when I was mad. If I had a horse 
I would Love it with all my heart. If I had a horse it would Be the best 
horse of all. If I had a horse I would Groom it and brush it and show it.
